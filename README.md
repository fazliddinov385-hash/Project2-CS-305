# CS 305 – Secure Software Development Portfolio  
## Artemis Financial Security Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains a completed security artifact from CS 305: Secure Software Development.  
The selected artifact demonstrates my ability to assess software vulnerabilities, apply secure coding practices, and document security findings in a professional manner.

## Client Summary and Software Requirements
Artemis Financial was the client for this project. The company provides financial services and required a secure software application to protect sensitive customer data. The primary concern was identifying and addressing software security vulnerabilities related to data transmission, encryption, and dependency management. The goal was to ensure secure communication using industry-standard encryption methods while following best practices for secure software development.

## Strengths and Importance of Secure Coding
One area I performed well in was identifying security vulnerabilities using both manual review and automated tools. I analyzed encryption practices, third-party dependencies, and configuration risks, then documented the findings clearly. Secure coding is essential because it protects sensitive data, prevents system compromise, and maintains customer trust. Strong software security adds value to a company by reducing financial, legal, and reputational risk.

## Challenges and Learning Experience
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was understanding and interpreting dependency vulnerabilities identified by automated scanning tools. This was also the most valuable learning experience, as it highlighted how third-party libraries can introduce significant risks if not properly maintained or monitored.

## Security Layers and Future Assessment Methods
I increased layers of security by implementing secure communication using HTTPS with TLS, addressing vulnerable dependencies, and following secure coding principles. In the future, I would continue using tools such as OWASP Dependency-Check, static code analysis tools, and established security frameworks to assess vulnerabilities and determine appropriate mitigation strategies.

## Testing for Functionality and Security
To ensure the software remained functional and secure after refactoring, I rebuilt and tested the application, verified secure encryption implementation, and re-ran vulnerability scans. These steps helped confirm that no new vulnerabilities were introduced and that the application continued to function as intended.

## Tools, Resources, and Practices Used
Key tools and practices used in this project included OWASP Dependency-Check, secure Java coding standards, Maven dependency management, and industry security guidelines. These tools and practices will be valuable in future coursework and professional software development tasks.

## Portfolio Value for Future Employers
This project provides a strong example of my ability to analyze software security risks, apply secure coding practices, and document findings clearly. For future employers, this artifact demonstrates practical experience with vulnerability assessment, secure software development, and industry-recognized security tools.
